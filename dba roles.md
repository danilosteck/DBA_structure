Here is a table highlighting the main differences in scope for on-premise and cloud DBAs:

| Aspect                  | On-premise DBA                                                          | Cloud DBA                                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure          | Manage physical hardware, servers, storage, and network components.    | Focus on cloud-based infrastructure, leveraging provider services.|
| Deployment & Provision  | Install, configure, and deploy databases on in-house infrastructure.   | Use cloud-based tools and services to deploy and manage databases.|
| Capacity Planning       | Plan for storage, memory, and CPU capacity on in-house servers.        | Monitor cloud resource usage, and scale resources as needed.      |
| Backup & Disaster Recovery | Manage backups, restore processes, and disaster recovery on local hardware. | Use cloud-based backup and recovery solutions offered by the provider.|
| Performance Tuning      | Optimize performance on in-house hardware, servers, and networks.      | Optimize performance in a cloud environment, focusing on provider-specific services and tools.|
| Maintenance & Updates   | Apply updates and patches manually to database software and operating systems. | Rely on cloud provider for automatic updates and patching (depending on the service level).|
| Security                | Implement security measures for in-house hardware and networks.        | Ensure security in a cloud environment, working with provider tools and services.|
| Cost Management         | Manage costs associated with physical hardware, power, and maintenance. | Manage costs related to cloud-based resources and services.         |

This table outlines the key differences between on-premise and cloud DBAs, with on-premise DBAs focusing on physical infrastructure and in-house systems, while cloud DBAs leverage cloud-based tools and services to manage databases. Although there are differences in their focus, both roles share the responsibility of ensuring database performance, security, and reliability.
